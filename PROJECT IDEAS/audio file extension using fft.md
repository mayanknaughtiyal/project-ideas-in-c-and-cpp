**Dynamic Fourier Transform Audio Encoding System**

### **Overview**
The Dynamic Fourier Transform Audio Encoding (D-FTA) system is a novel audio compression and storage method designed to optimize audio file sizes while preserving perceptual quality. This system introduces a new file extension, `.ftae`, which stands for Fourier Transformed Audio Enhanced. The compression and playback process leverages advanced methods to ensure storage efficiency, adaptability, and real-world applicability.

### **Key Features**
1. **Dynamic Window Size for FFT**
   - The system analyzes the input audio in the time domain and applies the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using variable window sizes.
   - The window size is dynamically adjusted based on the complexity of the audio signal (e.g., shorter windows for high-energy or complex sections, larger windows for simpler sections).

2. **Radix-2 FFT Implementation**
   - A recursive Radix-2 implementation of FFT is employed for efficiency.
   - This approach reduces computational complexity and improves processing speed, making it suitable for real-time applications.

3. **Data Struct for Storage**
   - The output of the FFT is encapsulated in a custom structure:
     ```c
     struct SineWave {
         int phase;
         int amplitude;
         int frequency;
     };
     ```
   - A queue of these structures is created to represent the audio data in the `.ftae` file.

4. **Advanced Filtering and Optimization**
   - **Frequency Thresholding**: Structures with frequencies outside the human audible range (20 Hz to 20 kHz) are discarded.
   - **Amplitude Thresholding**: Structures with amplitudes below a configurable threshold are removed.
   - **Phase Optimization**:
     - Opposite-phase sine waves are identified and eliminated.
     - Nearly opposite-phase sine waves are compared and selectively removed.
   - **Similarity Filtering**: Duplicate or nearly identical structures are detected and consolidated.

5. **Compression Levels**
   - Compression aggressiveness can be adjusted based on predefined levels (Low, Medium, High), which control the thresholds for filtering and optimization.

6. **Inverse FFT for Playback**
   - During playback, the Inverse FFT (IFFT) is applied to the queue of structures to reconstruct the audio signal.
   - The reconstructed signal is fed to the speaker for audio output.

### **Compression Workflow**
1. **Input Audio Format**:
   - The system accepts common uncompressed formats like `.wav` as input.

2. **FFT with Variable Window Sizes**:
   - Analyze the audio to detect time-domain patterns and apply FFT with adaptive window sizes.
   - Store the results in a queue of `SineWave` structs.

3. **Filtering and Optimization**:
   - Apply threshold-based filtering on amplitude and frequency.
   - Remove opposite-phase and nearly opposite-phase sine waves.
   - Consolidate similar sine wave structures.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Save the optimized queue of structures in a `.ftae` file.

5. **Playback**:
   - Read the `.ftae` file and reconstruct the audio using IFFT.
   - Output the reconstructed signal to the speaker.

### **Use Cases**
#### **Real-World Applications**
1. **Efficient Audio Storage**:
   - The `.ftae` format significantly reduces file sizes compared to `.wav` and `.mp3`, making it ideal for archival storage.

2. **Streaming Services**:
   - The reduced file size can enhance streaming efficiency, particularly in low-bandwidth environments.

3. **AI and Machine Learning Training**:
   - `.ftae` files provide a structured representation of audio data that is easier to analyze and process for AI models.
   - The sine wave-based format is especially suited for tasks requiring detailed spectral analysis, such as speech recognition and audio synthesis.

#### **Advantages Over Existing Formats**
1. **Storage Efficiency**:
   - By aggressively filtering and optimizing sine wave components, `.ftae` achieves higher compression ratios than `.mp3` and `.wav`.

2. **Customizable Compression**:
   - Users can adjust compression levels to balance quality and file size based on their needs.

3. **Enhanced AI Compatibility**:
   - The `.ftae` formatâ€™s structured representation simplifies preprocessing for machine learning tasks, reducing training times and improving model accuracy.

4. **Perceptual Optimization**:
   - Psychoacoustic principles are used to ensure that discarded components have minimal impact on perceived audio quality.

### **Conditions for Optimal Use**
1. **Best Scenarios**:
   - Applications requiring both high compression and high-quality playback.
   - Scenarios where audio data needs to be processed for machine learning or analytics.

2. **Limitations**:
   - For applications demanding absolute fidelity (e.g., studio mastering), `.ftae` may introduce slight perceptual losses.

### **Implementation in C**
#### **Step-by-Step Approach**
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Load the input `.wav` file and convert it to a suitable data structure for processing.

2. **Apply FFT**:
   - Implement a Radix-2 recursive FFT algorithm.
   - Use variable window sizes based on time-domain signal analysis.

3. **Create Structs and Queue**:
   - Store FFT outputs (phase, amplitude, frequency) in `SineWave` structs.
   - Add the structs to a queue for processing.

4. **Filtering and Optimization**:
   - Apply amplitude and frequency thresholds.
   - Remove opposite-phase and similar sine waves.

5. **Store in `.ftae`**:
   - Serialize the optimized queue and write it to a `.ftae` file.

6. **Playback with IFFT**:
   - Deserialize the `.ftae` file to reconstruct the queue.
   - Apply IFFT to reconstruct the audio signal and send it to the speaker.

#### **Implementation Details**
1. **Libraries and Tools**:
   - Use **FFTW** (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) for FFT and IFFT computations.
   - Leverage **standard C libraries** for file handling and data serialization.

2. **Dynamic Window Size Analysis**:
   - Implement a custom algorithm to calculate signal energy for each segment in the time domain.
   - Use thresholds to classify segments as high-complexity or low-complexity and adjust the FFT window size accordingly.

3. **File Format and Extensions**:
   - During storage, append a `.fta` extension to the file for standard FFT-based compression.
   - When advanced filtering (e.g., phase and amplitude optimization) is applied, update the extension to `.ftae`.
   - Dynamically switch between compression levels based on user input by applying different thresholds for filtering.
     - **Threshold Level 1**: Only remove opposite-phase sine waves.
     - **Threshold Level 2**: Perform all finalized techniques, including amplitude filtering, phase optimization, and similarity filtering.

4. **Compression-Level Switching**:
   - Use command-line arguments or a configuration file to set compression levels during processing.
   - Integrate a state machine to toggle between lossless and highly compressed modes dynamically during runtime.

5. **Playback**:
   - Deserialize `.ftae` files and feed the queue directly into the IFFT algorithm.
   - Use a buffering system to ensure smooth playback during real-time reconstruction.
