That sounds like a pretty exciting and complex project! Designing an embedded crypto accelerator focused on post-quantum cryptography (PQC), especially with Kyber KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism), and specialized accelerators like NTT (Number Theoretic Transform), ZVK, ZBKB, and ZKN, involves many layers of both hardware and software design.

Let’s break this down into key components and focus on how to implement and simulate without hardware:
1. RISC-V Core and Verilog Integration

Since you’re using RISC-V, you can design a custom accelerator as a coprocessor that communicates with the RISC-V core via the standard bus (like AXI or Wishbone) for data transfer. The Verilog code should include:

    Custom RISC-V Extensions: Since you’re focusing on cryptography, you'll likely need custom instructions or coprocessor extensions for Kyber, NTT, and others. RISC-V’s modular architecture makes it easy to add custom extensions, so you can define custom opcodes for the cryptographic operations that will be accelerated by your hardware.

    Co-Processor Design: The cryptographic hardware can be implemented as a co-processor attached to the RISC-V core. Verilog will be used to implement the actual hardware (e.g., for NTT, modular arithmetic, matrix multiplications, etc.).

    Pipeline Design: Ensure your pipeline design supports parallel execution, as cryptographic algorithms can benefit from pipelining and parallelism, especially for operations like NTT.

2. PQC Algorithms and Cryptographic Operations

    Kyber KEM: Implementing Kyber involves modular arithmetic and polynomial multiplication. Since it uses NTT for efficient polynomial multiplication, your accelerator should be optimized to handle these efficiently. You would implement the FFT-based NTT in Verilog, potentially using specialized hardware for FFT and inverse FFT (for operations like key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation).

    NTT Accelerator: Implement the NTT algorithm in Verilog by using a combination of look-up tables, butterfly operations, and modular arithmetic (mod a prime modulus). You'll want to optimize this for speed and size, as this will be a core component of your accelerator.

    ZVK, ZBKB, ZKN: These are specific optimizations for the KEM process in some PQC schemes. You would need to ensure that your accelerator can handle these efficiently as well.

3. True Random Number Generation (TRNG)

A True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is important in cryptography, especially for key generation. Although a QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator) using a camera sensor is an interesting idea, it does add complexity. If you don’t have hardware access, you can simulate this process by modeling noise or entropy sources in a software-based random number generator that mimics real-world random behavior.

    Simulating TRNG: You can simulate random noise using something like an entropy source in software (e.g., generating numbers based on random bit patterns from system noise or pseudo-random functions). For the camera sensor idea, you could simulate the output of a camera sensor using a noise model in software.

    If True Random Number Generation (TRNG) is Required: Since you’re working on the simulation, you could simulate the TRNG using high-entropy data from a software-based noise generator. In Verilog, you could use pseudo-random number generators or other techniques for entropy gathering (e.g., based on system states or memory states).

4. Simulation Without Hardware

    Verilog Testbenches: Since you don’t have access to hardware, creating testbenches in Verilog is a crucial way to simulate and verify your design. You can write testbenches to simulate various inputs to your cryptographic accelerator and ensure that the accelerations work as expected (e.g., validating Kyber KEM key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation).

    FPGA Simulation: You can use FPGA development tools like Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus to simulate your Verilog designs. These tools provide software-based simulations that allow you to verify your design logic without needing physical hardware.

    RISC-V Simulation: For the RISC-V part, you can use simulators like QEMU (for software simulation) or Spike (RISC-V simulator) to simulate the interaction between your custom coprocessor and the RISC-V core. This will allow you to test how the RISC-V core interacts with the custom cryptographic accelerator you implement.

    Software Emulation: In addition to hardware simulation, you can create a software emulator of your accelerator using high-level programming languages (e.g., C or Python) to simulate how your hardware will behave. This is especially useful for algorithms like Kyber KEM, where you can test the logic without needing to implement the hardware first.

5. Key Features to Include

Besides the core cryptographic operations, here are some other features you might want to include:

    Data Integrity Checks: Implement features like checksums, hashes, or error correction to ensure that the cryptographic operations are error-free.

    Power Efficiency: Since this is an embedded design, you should consider low-power design techniques, such as clock gating and voltage scaling, to optimize power consumption.

    Security Features: Consider adding side-channel attack mitigations (e.g., constant-time operations) to your Verilog code, especially since cryptographic accelerators are often targets for side-channel attacks.

    Performance Metrics: Add performance counters to your hardware to measure throughput, latency, and resource utilization.

6. Presenting Without Hardware

    Simulation and Visualization: As mentioned, you can simulate the behavior of your design using Verilog testbenches and other simulation tools. You could also create a visualization of the simulation results (e.g., timing diagrams, waveform charts, or performance plots) to show how your accelerator works.

    Software Emulator/Model: You can build a software model of your accelerator in a higher-level language like C or Python, which mimics the behavior of your hardware and can show results without requiring physical hardware.

    Presentation: For a presentation without hardware, focus on algorithmic correctness, performance analysis, and theoretical power/area estimates. This could include using simulation results and visual aids to explain how your hardware would accelerate these algorithms.

In Summary:

    RISC-V Core and Verilog: Implement a custom accelerator in Verilog, with specialized instructions for PQC algorithms (like Kyber KEM) and optimizations like NTT.

    PQC Algorithms: Focus on modular arithmetic and efficient polynomial multiplication.

    Simulating Hardware: Use testbenches, FPGA simulation tools, and software emulation to simulate your design.

    TRNG: Implement a software-based entropy source for simulation of TRNG if needed.

    Presentation: Use simulation outputs and software models to demonstrate the functionality, performance, and potential of your accelerator.

This should give you a solid foundation for your embedded crypto accelerator project. How deep are you into the Verilog and RISC-V integration so far?

Apologies for not providing a detailed, structured layout. Let me break it down step by step with a focus on your embedded crypto accelerator for post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which includes key pair generation, secure key transportation, digital signatures, and other cryptographic operations like Kyber KEM and NTT accelerations. I'll provide a clear outline of the modules, their functions, interconnections, and how they fit together to support your goals.
Overview of the Accelerator Layout

Your accelerator will consist of several key components:

    RISC-V Core: Acts as the main processor, controlling the flow of the system and initiating the cryptographic operations.

    Crypto Co-Processor: A dedicated accelerator for specific cryptographic operations (e.g., PQC algorithms, NTT).

    True Random Number Generator (TRNG): For secure key generation and cryptographic operations that require randomness.

    Bus Interface: Facilitates communication between the RISC-V core, the co-processor, and memory.

    Memory Subsystem: Handles the storage of keys, public/private data, and intermediate results.

    Control and Status Registers: Used to configure and monitor the status of cryptographic operations.

Modules and Their Functions
1. RISC-V Core (Main Processor)

    Purpose: Controls the entire accelerator, handling the orchestration of cryptographic tasks, managing interrupts, and issuing instructions to the cryptographic co-processor.

    Key Role: RISC-V core will:

        Trigger cryptographic operations like key pair generation (Kyber KEM), signing, and verification.

        Manage memory (storing public/private keys, signatures, etc.).

        Communicate with the co-processor for computationally heavy operations (e.g., NTT-based polynomial multiplications).

Inputs/Outputs:

    Inputs: Commands for crypto operations, data to be encrypted/decrypted, keys.

    Outputs: Results of cryptographic operations, status, error flags.

2. Crypto Co-Processor

The heart of your accelerator, this module will handle most of the computation-heavy tasks. This co-processor will include specialized modules for Kyber KEM, NTT, and possibly digital signatures.
Key Sub-modules inside Crypto Co-Processor:

    NTT Accelerator:

        Purpose: Efficiently handles the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), which is used in Kyber KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism) for polynomial multiplication.

        How: Implemented using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach with a modulus prime qq and polynomial coefficients. The NTT implementation may leverage Radix-2 or Radix-4 algorithms to achieve high throughput.

        Inputs: Polynomials (input data), modulus qq, coefficients for multiplication.

        Outputs: Transformed polynomials (after NTT or inverse NTT).

    Kyber KEM Accelerator:

        Purpose: Handles the core operations of the Kyber KEM algorithm:

            Key Generation (e.g., polynomial sampling, encoding).

            Encapsulation (public key encryption).

            Decapsulation (private key decryption).

        How: Key generation uses polynomial sampling based on the error distribution (like Gaussian sampling). The encapsulation and decapsulation involve polynomial multiplication using NTT, modular arithmetic, and hashing.

        Inputs: Public/private keys, data to be encapsulated/decapsulated, randomness for key generation.

        Outputs: Encapsulated keys, decrypted data.

    Digital Signature Accelerator (if applicable):

        Purpose: If implementing post-quantum digital signature algorithms (like Falcon or SPHINCS+), this module will handle:

            Key pair generation.

            Signing messages.

            Verifying signatures.

        How: Involves signing through hash-based signatures, hash functions, and often polynomial operations.

        Inputs: Message (for signing), private key (for signing), public key (for verification).

        Outputs: Signed message, verification status.

3. True Random Number Generator (TRNG)

    Purpose: Essential for secure key generation (for both key pair generation and random nonces used in encryption). It should generate high-entropy random numbers.

    How: A hardware-based TRNG might use an oscillator or noise-based source. However, if hardware is unavailable, you can simulate this in software or use pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) based on entropy sources in the system.

    Inputs: Requests for random numbers.

    Outputs: Generated random bits, entropy pool (used for further operations).

4. Memory Subsystem

    Purpose: Stores keys, cryptographic parameters, and other necessary data for cryptographic operations.

    How: The memory system will consist of RAM (for temporary data) and non-volatile storage (for permanent key storage). You may also want caches to speed up frequent operations.

    Inputs: Data to be stored or retrieved (keys, signatures, encrypted data).

    Outputs: Retrieved data (e.g., public/private keys, signatures).

5. Bus Interface

    Purpose: Ensures communication between the RISC-V core, the crypto co-processor, and memory.

    How: A standard AXI or Wishbone bus interface would allow the RISC-V core to issue read/write commands to the cryptographic hardware and memory.

    Inputs: Data from the RISC-V core or memory controller.

    Outputs: Data to the RISC-V core or memory.

6. Control and Status Registers (CSR)

    Purpose: Provides control over cryptographic operations and status reporting (for debugging or monitoring).

    How: These registers allow the RISC-V core to set parameters like the mode of the crypto operation (key generation, signing, etc.) and read back results (e.g., completion flags, error codes).

    Inputs: Configuration bits, commands from the RISC-V core.

    Outputs: Status flags, error codes, operation results.

Connections Between Modules

The modules will be connected through the system bus (like AXI or Wishbone). The RISC-V core will send commands to the crypto co-processor for cryptographic operations and store/retrieve data from memory. The co-processor will handle the bulk of computations (like polynomial multiplications in NTT or Kyber) and use the TRNG for random number generation when needed.

Here’s a flow of how the system might work:

    RISC-V Core initiates a key generation operation (e.g., Kyber KEM).

    It sends the request to the crypto co-processor along with any necessary data (public key, randomness, etc.).

    The crypto co-processor runs the required computations, utilizing the NTT and Kyber KEM accelerators.

    The TRNG is called during key generation to produce fresh random numbers.

    After the key generation, the public and private keys are stored in the memory subsystem.

    The RISC-V Core may then use these keys for secure communication, signing operations, or other cryptographic tasks.

Processor Focus

In terms of what your processor should focus on:

    Key Pair Generation: This is a core task in many PQC algorithms (e.g., Kyber KEM), so having optimized hardware accelerators for key generation is essential.

    Digital Signature Operations: If you implement post-quantum signature schemes (like Falcon, SPHINCS+), your processor should focus on optimizing the signing and verification processes.

    Secure Key Transportation: For secure key transport, focus on implementing encryption/decryption engines and secure key storage mechanisms.

For efficient performance, you should ensure that key operations like modular arithmetic, polynomial multiplication, and hashing are offloaded to hardware accelerators, leaving the RISC-V core to manage control flow and memory management.
Conclusion

    Modules: RISC-V core, crypto co-processor (Kyber KEM, NTT, signature), TRNG, memory subsystem, control registers.

    Connections: All modules are connected via the bus interface for communication, while the RISC-V core manages and controls the flow.

    Focus: Your processor should focus on key generation, digital signatures, and secure key transportation while offloading computationally heavy tasks (like NTT and polynomial arithmetic) to hardware accelerators.

This should give you a solid foundation for your embedded crypto accelerator. Would you like further details on any specific module or interaction?
