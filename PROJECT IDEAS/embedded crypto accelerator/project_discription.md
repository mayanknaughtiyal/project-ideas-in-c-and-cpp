# MY PROJECT IS TO MAKE A CRYPTO ACCELATOR USING RISC-V AND ITS CRYPTO ACCELERATOR

## As my project is focused on embedded system so for lower footprint i will use rv-32 bit base isa and will use the following extensions 
> M :- for multiplication and divison operations as they are highly used in PQC

> v :- for vector register file and vector operations\highly used in PQC algorithms

> C :- for compressed instruction size for memory optimization

###  It will use the following crypto extensions to achieve PQC
> j
