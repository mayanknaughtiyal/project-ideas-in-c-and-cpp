# MY PROJECT IS TO MAKE A CRYPTO ACCELATOR USING RISC-V AND ITS CRYPTO ACCELERATOR

## As my project is focused on embedded system so for lower footprint i will use rv-32 bit base isa and will use the following extensions 
> M :- for multiplication and divison operations as they are highly used in PQC

> v :- for vector register file and vector operations\highly used in PQC algorithms

> B:-for bit manipulation instructions(useful for polynomial multiplication and bit level optimization ) 

> C :- for compressed instruction size for memory optimization


###  It will use the following crypto extensions to achieve PQC
> zvk :- accelarates NTT (for lattice based PQC algoritms like kyber)

>zvkb :-for 

## It will have the following properties
* will have constant time logic for resistance to side channel attack
* seperate unit for NTT(Number Theoretic Transform)
*
